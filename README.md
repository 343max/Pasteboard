# Pasteboard

Pasteboard is an experiment to share Clipboard Content between a Mac and an iOS Device without having to start an App on iOS to do so: it was supposed to just work. To reach this goal it uses Bluettoth LE.

This kind of works sometimes. When it works it is very slow. But it is fun and it is one of the few examples out there that uses CoreBluetooth.
